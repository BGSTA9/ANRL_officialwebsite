## 1. Lab Identity & Mission

### Lab Name
- Official name: Argo Navis Research Laboratory
- Acronym (if any): ANReLa
- Preferred display name: Argo Navis Research Laboratory

### Mission & Focus
- **What is the primary research focus of your lab?** 
    - Argo Navis is an independent research laboratory dedicated solely to *Number Theory*. We conduct research through computational number theory by building high-fidelity simulations and training deep neural networks to uncover the hidden algorithmic patterns governing the nature of reality.
- What problems are you trying to solve?
    - Number Theory is about studying intergers, more specifically studying primes and their properties; thus, our core mission is to investigate the deep structure of the integers, specifically the enigmatic properties of prime numbers. We target the field's most persistent normal and open problems, using simulation to probe where analytical proofs have stalled. Beyond pure theory, we apply our findings to critical real-world systems, advancing the mathematical foundations of modern cryptography, coding theory, etc ...
- What makes your approach unique or different?
    - While traditional number theory relies primarily on deductive reasoning and formal proof, Argo Navis introduces a computational paradigm. We view the set of integers not just as a logical structure, but as a vast, high-dimensional dataset waiting to be deciphered. By deploying deep neural networks as observational instruments, we can detect subtle, non-linear correlations in arithmetic distributions that remain invisible to classical analytical methods. Our approach is distinct in its integration of High-Fidelity Simulation with Theoretical Intuition. We do not simply use computers to verify known results; we build generative models that simulate complex number-theoretic landscapes—from elliptic curves to prime constellations. These simulations act as a "digital laboratory," allowing us to stress-test conjectures and discover hidden algorithms within the noise before a formal proof is ever attempted.
