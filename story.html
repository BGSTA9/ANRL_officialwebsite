                            <strong>Argo Navis</strong> is an independent and non-profit research laboratory dedicated
                            to the field of
                            <strong>Number Theory</strong>. We believe the
                            deepest
                            truths of mathematics are best uncovered through the engagement of computational power and
                            theoretical
                            intuition.

                        We do not wait for inspiration; we generate it. Before we attempt to prove a theorem, we
                        simulate it. We believe that high-fidelity data provides the ground truth necessary to guide
                        intuition. If the simulation doesn't support the hypothesis, we discard the hypothesis, not the
                        data.

                        We care about what you can build, not where you studied. A working GitHub repository or a novel
                        simulation holds more weight here than a transcript. We judge ideas by their predictive power
                        and mathematical validity, never by the rank or title of the person proposing them.

                        Knowledge grows when it is shared, not siloed. We build in public. Our datasets, simulation
                        engines, and pre-print drafts are open-source by default. We believe the future of science is
                        decentralized and collaborative, not hidden behind paywalls.

                        Reality is a puzzle, not a black box. We are driven by an obsessive curiosity to find the signal
                        in the noise. We are not satisfied with "it works"; we need to know why it works. We interrogate
                        our AI models to understand the geometric logic they have learned.
