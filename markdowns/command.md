## 1. Lab Identity & Mission

### Lab Name
- Official name: Argo Navis Research Laboratory
- Acronym (if any): ANReLa
- Preferred display name: Argo Navis Research Laboratory

### Mission & Focus
- **What is the primary research focus of your lab?** 
    - Argo Navis is an independent research laboratory dedicated solely to *Number Theory*. We conduct research through computational number theory by building high-fidelity simulations and training deep neural networks to uncover the hidden algorithmic patterns governing the nature of reality.
- What problems are you trying to solve?
    - Number Theory is about studying intergers, more specifically studying primes and their properties; thus, our core mission is to investigate the deep structure of the integers, specifically the enigmatic properties of prime numbers. We target the field's most persistent normal and open problems, using simulation to probe where analytical proofs have stalled. Beyond pure theory, we apply our findings to critical real-world systems, advancing the mathematical foundations of modern cryptography, coding theory, etc ...
- What makes your approach unique or different?
    - While traditional number theory relies primarily on deductive reasoning and formal proof, Argo Navis introduces a computational paradigm. We view the set of integers not just as a logical structure, but as a vast, high-dimensional dataset waiting to be deciphered. By deploying deep neural networks as observational instruments, we can detect subtle, non-linear correlations in arithmetic distributions that remain invisible to classical analytical methods. Our approach is distinct in its integration of High-Fidelity Simulation with Theoretical Intuition. We do not simply use computers to verify known results; we build generative models that simulate complex number-theoretic landscapes—from elliptic curves to prime constellations. These simulations act as a "digital laboratory," allowing us to stress-test conjectures and discover hidden algorithms within the noise before a formal proof is ever attempted.

### Lab Culture
- How would you describe your lab's culture?
    - dismiss, this is for later updates ...
- What values are important to your team?
    - **Compute Over Conjecture**: We do not wait for inspiration; we generate it. Before we attempt to prove a theorem, we simulate it. We believe that high-fidelity data provides the "ground truth" necessary to guide intuition. If the simulation doesn't support the hypothesis, we discard the hypothesis, not the data.
    - **Output Over Credentials**: We care about what you can build, not where you studied. A working GitHub repository or a novel simulation holds more weight here than a transcript. We judge ideas by their predictive power and mathematical validity, never by the rank or title of the person proposing them.
    - **Radical Transparency (Open Science)**: Knowledge grows when it is shared, not siloed. We "build in public." Our datasets, simulation engines, and pre-print drafts are open-source by default. We believe the future of science is decentralized and collaborative, not hidden behind paywalls.
    - **The "Deciphering" Spirit**: Reality is a puzzle, not a black box. We are driven by an obsessive curiosity to find the signal in the noise. We are not satisfied with "it works"; we need to know why it works. We interrogate our AI models to understand the geometric logic they have learned.
